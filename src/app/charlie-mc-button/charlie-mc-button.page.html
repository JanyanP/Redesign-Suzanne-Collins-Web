    <div id="sinopsis">
      When a thunderstorm knocks out the electricity, Charlie McButton's whole tech empire comes 
      tumbling down. He needs batteries–FAST. But the only batteries are inside his baby sister's beloved 
      talking doll. Will he resort to desperate measures, and cause his sister to have a meltdown of her 
      own? Or will he snap out of his computer craze long enough to realize sisters can be fun, even 
      without batteries?

            "A clever, humorous story in rhyme. Charlie's techno-driven world comes to a crashing halt when a 
            thunderstorm causes a power outage. His mother advises, "You'll have to find something without plugs 
            to play./Read a book!/Clean your room!/Sing a song!/Model clay!" Uninspired, Charlie finally remembers 
            an old handheld video game, but the battery is missing. Desperate, he steals one from his sister's 
            talking doll and ends up in the time-out chair. Feeling remorseful when the little girl starts 
            crying, he seeks her out and the two have a grand time playing games and pretending to be dragons and 
            wizards. When the power returns, Charlie is ready to retreat to his "handsets and bots" but decides 
            that it might be fun to spend some time with his sister as well. The hilarious cartoon illustrations 
            are bold and appealing and depict the siblings' many emotions with exaggerated clarity. While the 
            mother appears only as a hand patting her panicked son's head, the family dog is usually present, 
            patiently enduring a hose-down from little Isabel Jane or angrily reproving Charlie for hurting her 
            feelings. Pair this tale with Glenn McCoy's Penny Lee and Her TV (Hyperion, 2002) for a fun storytime 
            during 'TV Turnoff Week.'"

            "Charlie loves computer games so much, he never plays with anything else - so when the power goes out, 
            he's really in the dark. His desperate search for batteries involves his sister's toys and some nasty 
            behavior before he settles down to realize what's truly important in his life. Deftly written by Suzanne 
            Collins and nicely illustrated by Mike Lester, When Charlie McButton Lost Power is refreshingly original 
            and moving!"

            "A computer-game addict temporarily turns into a raving lunatic when a power failure shuts 
            down his PC, and Lester is well up to the task of portraying his breakdown. He sends red-haired 
            Charlie, pop-eyed features wildly distorted with panic, dashing after an old gameboy, then 
            brutalizing his little sister Isabel Jane's talking doll for a triple-A battery. When this behavior 
            instantly relegates him to the Time-Out Chair, Charlie yells (captured in the art by a gross-looking 
            spray of red and yellow) at Isabel Jane, which sends her away in tears—but then also causes him to 
            reflect remorsefully on how much he actually enjoys her company. Once off the chair, he seeks her 
            out for a game of hide-and-seek. Collins tells the tale in loosely written verse and leaves Charlie, 
            as the house explodes with restored light, thinking that he might go play with his sibling some more 
            before plugging in again. Unlikely to work as behavior modification, but young geeks may take a break 
            from their screens to enjoy the over-the-top art."
