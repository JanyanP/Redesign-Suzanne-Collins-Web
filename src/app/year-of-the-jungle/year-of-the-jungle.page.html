            "In this picture book, Collins sensitively examines the impact of war on the very young, using her 
            own family history as a template. Suzy is the youngest of four children—Proimos draws her with 
            impossibly big, questioning blue eyes and a mass of frizzy red hair—and she is struggling to 
            understand the changes in her family. "My dad has to go to something called a war," she explains. 
            "It's in a place called Viet Nam. Where is Viet Nam? He will be gone a year. How long is a year? 
            I don't know what anybody's talking about." When Suzy learns that her father is in the jungle, 
            she imagines something akin to the setting of her favorite cartoon (Collins suggests it's George 
            of the Jungle). As the months wear on, though, Suzy begins to piece together the danger her father 
            is in, whether it's through the increasingly unnerving postcards he sends (one reads, "Pray for me," 
            in closing) or by catching a snippet of wartime violence on the news. "Explosions. Helicopters. 
            Guns. Soldiers lie on the ground. Some of them aren't moving." In four wordless spreads, Proimos 
            makes Suzy's awakening powerfully clear, as the gray jungle she initially pictured (populated by 
            four smiling, brightly colored animals) gives way to a more violent vision, as the animals morph 
            into weapons of war. Just when Suzy's confusion and fear reach an apex: "Then suddenly my dad's 
            home." As in Collins's Hunger Games books, the fuzzy relationship between fear and bravery, and 
            the reality of combat versus an imagined (or, in the case of those books, manufactured) version of 
            it is at the forefront of this story. By the final pages, Suzy has come to understand that "Some 
            things have changed but some things will always be the same." It's a deceptively simple message of 
            reassurance that readers who may currently be in Suzy's situation can take to heart, whether their 
            loved ones return changed, as hers did, or don't return at all. Ages 4–up."

            "Suzanne Collins, author of the famously bloody "Hunger Games" trilogy, has written a picture-book 
            memoir about what life at home is like for a child whose father has gone away to war. Collins's own 
            father went to Vietnam the year she turned 6, and she's said the experience had a profound effect on 
            him. But though post-traumatic stress disorder is often spoken of these days, the more subtle effects 
            of war on the children of men and women serving abroad are less well known. "Year of the Jungle" is 
            narrated by a little red-haired girl named Sue, whose father reads her poems by Ogden Nash. Her 
            favorite is about a dragon named Custard that "keeps crying for a nice safe cage." Sue thinks that 
            while Custard "always feels afraid, he is really the bravest of all. And that's what makes him 
            special." When her father leaves for Vietnam, Sue must follow Custard's example. The year "goes on 
            and on." Sue waits. She measures the passing of time by the arrival of a turkey, a Christmas tree, 
            shamrocks and colored eggs. There is a postcard with a picture of Saigon, then one with a picture 
            of a Vietnamese fisherman. The children watch their mother, worried she might be "going to the jungle, 
            too," but she stays. Sue's initial impression of the jungle is positive. Her "favorite cartoon character 
            lives in a jungle," and she thinks she'd like to go to Vietnam to find her father. She will fly there. 
            "You can fly anywhere in your dreams." But over the course of the year, the dream begins to darken. 
            The postcards stop coming. Then Sue's father sends her a birthday card when it isn't her birthday, and 
            she begins to realize that "the jungle must be a very confusing place" for her father to have made 
            "such a serious mistake." One day, she watches graphic footage of the war on television, and her mother 
            rushes in to turn off the set. Sue is afraid, but she doesn't have the language to describe her fear. 
            She hides in the closet to cry alone. While Sue is not able to formulate her feelings in words, James 
            Proimos's excellent illustrations capture her confusion. In one image, Sue imagines the landscape of 
            Vietnam as a place with green elephants shooting white blobby monsters from their trunks and yellow 
            goblins rising from coffee cups, while a rhino-shaped helicopter floats overhead. This visual nightmare 
            mirrors a child's skewed perception of war so well that it is clear Sue is going through her own version 
            of hell. At the end of the year, Sue's father returns, "tired and thin," his skin "the color of pancake 
            syrup." He "stares into space. He is here but not here." "Some things have changed," Sue reflects, "but 
            some things will always be the same." In other words, bad things happen, but life goes on. "Year of the 
            Jungle" may take place in the late 1960s, but with more than 2.3 million Americans deployed abroad 
            between 2001 and 2012, the mixture of anxiety, excitement, fear, boredom and confusion Sue experiences 
            on the home front will be sadly familiar to many children. For them, Collins's picture book may be a 
            good tool to discuss the complex feelings war brings into a household. Children are sure to ask why 
            Sue's father went away, and why he was different when he returned. Maybe some frank discussions about 
            war, ones that involve more than stories about courageous dragons, will help children better understand 
            what military service entails. "Year of the Jungle" brings up big questions. Parents will need to 
            provide the answers ."

            "Suzanne Collins' autobiographical picture book, Year of the Jungle: Memories from the Home Front, 
            seems a sharp departure for the author of The Hunger Games, the best-selling dystopian trilogy. 
            But in a reassuring and deceptively simple way, Jungle, aimed at readers 4 and up, continues Collins' 
            exploration of the effect of war and violence on kids. In Hunger Games, for readers 12 and up, teens 
            are forced to kill or be killed as part of state-sponsored entertainment. In Collins' first fantasy 
            series, the Underland Chronicles, for readers 8 and up, two kids fall into an underground world on 
            the brink of war. Jungle (Scholastic), illustrated by James Proimos,is narrated by Suzy, a 
            frizzy-haired, big-eyed first grader whose dad is sent "to something called a war" in a "place 
            called Viet Nam." Suzy confesses, "I don't know what anybody's talking about." When she hears 
            Vietnam is a jungle, she thinks of a cartoon set in a jungle where elephants and apes pal around. 
            Reality intrudes when Suzy accidentally sees a TV news report from Vietnam with explosions, guns 
            and soldiers on the ground. "Some of them aren't moving," she reports. Her worst fears are conveyed 
            without words, just Proimos' paintings. Suzy's dad returns home, just as Collins' own dad, an Air 
            Force officer, did in 1968. Collins offers no moralizing on war, just a vivid reminder of what it's 
            like to be young and innocent in a world that's not. I can see a lot of kids whose parents are in 
            someplace called Afghanistan — or another confusing place — identifying with Suzy."

            "First-grader Suzy's father is in the jungles of Vietnam for a year. Through a tightly controlled 
            child's point of view, readers live the year with little Suzy in the sheltered world her parents 
            have built for her. She understands little at first, imagining romps in the jungle with elephants 
            and apes. Her father sends her postcards every so often with cheery scenes of the tropics. 
            Eventually, the postcards stop coming. She misses her dad, especially when her brother takes over 
            some of her father's duties, like reading the comics or Ogden Nash's poems to her. One day, the 
            wall of protection is broken by the television, with frightening visions of explosions, 
            helicopters, guns and dead soldiers. Her mother whisks her away, too late. Proimos' ink-and-digital 
            art, in his signature cartoon style, adds needed humor to a frankly scary story that honors Suzy's 
            experience and respects those who share it. Occasional full-page wordless spreads allow readers to 
            see into Suzy's mind, beginning with her flying through the jungle and leading up to her 
            post-epiphany anxiety about tanks and helicopters and rifles. With a notable lack of patriotic 
            rhetoric or clichés about bravery and honor, Collins holds firm to her childhood memories, 
            creating a universal story for any child whose life is disrupted by war. Important and necessary.

            "Collins mines her own experience to tell a tender, personal story of war seen through a child's 
            eyes. Firstgrader Suzy's father is deployed to Viet Nam. At first, though she misses him, she 
            dreams of the exotic jungle. But as the year goes on, marked by Christmas trees and candy hearts, 
            things get harder. His postcards arrive less and less frequently, while news of the war, and its 
            real dangers, comes more and more often. In the end Suzy's father returns, and while some things 
            are different, some things are the same. Collins' unflinching g first-person account details the 
            fears and disappointments of the situation as a child would experience them. And where more 
            realistic illustrations would feel overwrought and sentimental, Proimos's flat, cartoony drawings, 
            with their heavy lines and blocky shapes, are sturdy and sweet, reflecting a child's clear-eyed 
            innocence. While small, personal details and specific references to Viet Nam fix the story in one 
            child's individual experience, it is these very particularities that establish the kind of 
            indelible and heartfelt resonance to be universally understood. Indeed, children missing parents 
            in all kinds of circumstances will find comfort here."

            "This moving picture book recounts, through the author's eyes as a child, the year of her father's 
            military tour of duty in Viet Nam. The youngest of four kids growing up in a safe, loving family, 
            Suzy is first seen listening to her dad read Ogden Nash's poem about Custard, the dragon who stays 
            brave despite his inner fears. Thus the stage is set for her father's imminent deployment. In this 
            pre-Internet world, his postcards provide tenuous but tangible connections as the first grader 
            tries to comprehend what a jungle is, what her father is doing there, and the passage of time 
            ("Has it been a year yet?"). But Suzy's concerns increase when Dad confuses her birthday with a 
            sister's, and then the postcards cease. When one abruptly surfaces, Dad signs it, "Pray for me." 
            (She does, "very hard.") Television news and a near-drowning incident during a swimming lesson feed 
            the child's anxieties. Suddenly, Dad is home, "tired and thin… his skin… the color of pancake syrup." 
            Suzy struggles to articulate her harbored fears, which he gently allays, and the two resume reading 
            about Custard, whose stoicism surely resonates more deeply for them. Vibrantly colored cartoon 
            illustrations, outlined in thick black ink, underscore a child's point of view. The characters' 
            enormous eyes and boldly colored pupils provide an arresting motif. Suzy's increasingly haunted 
            imaginings, depicted on spreads of painterly gray tones with bursts of color, stand in stark visual 
            contrast to the narrative text and illustrations framed by generous white space. The author's 
            spot-on memories paired with child-friendly art create a universal exploration of war and its effect 
            on young children, ideally shared with and facilitated by a sensitive adult."

            "Collins, well known for her middle-school and YA fantasies, offers here a radical change of pace 
            in this picture book story inspired by her own childhood, documenting the year young Suzy's father 
            goes off to the Vietnam War. At first, the prospect doesn't sound all that bad to a rising 
            first-grader with little grasp of time; how long could one year be? Additionally, Dad is headed for 
            the jungle, and some of Suzy's favorite animals live (at least by her reckoning) in the jungle. A 
            year turns out to be a very long time, though, especially when postcards come only sporadically, 
            people's efforts at cheering her up only fill her with heretofore unconsidered anxieties, and Dad's 
            brief missives seem increasingly distanced and confused. Theirs is a happy-ish ending—Dad does come 
            home, although "he looks different. Tired and thin and his skin has turned the color of pancake 
            syrup. . . . He stares into space. He is here but not here." Collins' text is simple, but it's rich 
            in the telling details that establish the pervasive fear ("So many things are scary now") that 
            spills over into other aspects of the little girl's life—getting a birthday card from Dad that should 
            have gone to her sister, being showered with too much Halloween candy from a sympathetic neighbor, 
            having a terrifying experience of being tossed into a local swimming pool. Proimos' ink-lined, 
            digitally colored illustrations are the pitch-perfect tonal complement to Collins' narration, with 
            the family portrayed as wide-eyed, childlike cartoons that carry on with daily life in crayon-bright 
            hues, while young Suzy's angst-filled imaginings take shape in full-spread, full-bleed gray-tone 
            scenes that twist her innocent favorite animals into recurrent nightmarish motifs and symbols of war. 
            With text and illustrations that invite close reading, this will be a powerful title to share with 
            children well beyond picture-book age. EB"

            "Hunger Games trilogy author Suzanne Collins reverts to her years writing for youth television 
            programming like Scholastic Entertainment's Clifford's Puppy Days for Year of the Jungle, her 
            latest book release for her youngest audience yet. To her, it's the perfect age for kids to begin 
            digesting the complicated concept of war. Suzy, the protagonist in the autobiographical picture book, 
            is based on a 6-year-old Collins and her family during the year her father was deployed in Vietnam. 
            Suzy refers to it as Viet Nam and envisions it as the "jungle," but what appears as a picturesque 
            backdrop in children's cartoons soon morphs into a terrifying place, especially as images of the 
            first televised war creep into her family's home. She begins to understand where her father is, and 
            why exactly he asks her to "Pray for me." For three years, Collins thumbed through postcards and 
            gifts her father gave her while he was overseas. "I felt like there was a story here, but every 
            time I tried to visualize the book, I drew a blank," says Collins. "My fear was, with the subject 
            matter, that the impulse would be to make the art dark and very serious." Seasoned illustrator and 
            close friend James Proimos captures childlike fascination and fear when transforming the jungle from 
            a home for friendly animals to a field for frightening war tools. The book also reassures readers 
            that despite any parent's absence, their love for their children will never leave. "I hope people 
            will read the book, even if they don't have a deployed family member, even if they're not part of 
            a military family," says Collins. "Maybe it will help some kids understand what other kids might be 
            going through if they have a parent deployed overseas."

            "YEAR OF THE JUNGLE is a moving, personal account of how it feels to have a parent off at war when 
            you're too young to understand what war means or how long a year is. Little Suzy is confused and 
            misses her dad terribly, delighting in his postcards and praying for his return, and using her 
            imagination to picture him in the jungle. She's also a regular, smiley kid with a cat, two older 
            siblings, and a friend she draws with. Collins deftly balances the fear and freakout of a little 
            girl who learns her dad's in danger with the upbeat, optimistic portrayal of a kid going about 
            the business of being a kid. James Proimos' cartoony illustrations are more reassuring and funny 
            than scary. But there's one imagined war scene (with images of guns, tanks, airplanes, explosions), 
            and he clearly expresses Suzy's fear and worry when her eyes get very big, in one case filling 
            nearly the whole page."

            "In the last book of the "Hunger Games" trilogy, author Suzanne Collins offered a bleak vision 
            of war that felt personal. Now we know the source. In "Year of the Jungle" (Scholastic, $17.99, 
            ages 4 and older), Collins writes a child's-eye memoir of life during her father's tour in Vietnam 
            (with illustrations by James Proimos). Soldiers who go to war leave questions for families to live 
            with -- Where are they? What are they experiencing? Are they alive? -- and children are experts at 
            filling in gaps. The little girl hears her father is in the jungle, so she imagines the jungle she 
            knows from cartoons. The illustrations show how clues from the adult world feed her worries. She 
            is a thinker, and when her father arrives home, changed, she finds a way to reach him."

            "Year of the Jungle: Memories from the Home Front by Suzanne Collins, illustrated by James 
            Proimos (Scholastic £10.99), is an unusual, brave autobiographical experiment from the author 
            of The Hunger Games. It is about the year Collins's father was deployed to Vietnam when she 
            was a child. It's not sensational but nor does it evade the emotional issues involved. When 
            "worried ladies" (presumably friends of her mother's) tried to reassure her about her father – 
            "your dad will be just fine" – and gave her extra sweets, it had the unsurprising effect of 
            making her suddenly worried. Proimos ingeniously uses jungle pictures to illustrate her emotions. 
            When her father returns: "He is here but not here." Not an uncontroversial read yet not to be 
            missed. (5+)."

            "A masterful picture book excels at revealing a young child's experience during the year her father 
            is away at war. Suzy's dad has to go to a place called Viet Nam. She imagines flying in the 
            jungle—her favorite cartoon is set in a jungle—with her cat, Rascal. She is the youngest in a 
            family determined to shelter her from things she's not ready to understand. But they can't 
            protect her from good intentions. When she tells people her dad's in Viet Nam, they get worried. 
            At Halloween, "One of the worried ladies says, 'Your dad will be just fine,' and gives me way too 
            much extra candy. I start to feel worried, too." Over the year there are many unsettling events. 
            One of her dad's postcards says "Pray for me." He sends her a birthday card in winter, but her 
            birthday is in summer. She accidentally sees a news report about Viet Nam. "Later I hide in the 
            closet and cry." The postcards stop. Suzy's flights of imagination become darker, tainted by fear 
            she can't express. It's only when her dad returns that she can finally speak that fear, if 
            indirectly, when she tells him, "Rascal didn't think you were coming back." Suzanne Collins mines 
            her own childhood memories, transforming them with tremendous skill into a story that is resonant 
            and truthful and timeless and remarkably child-centered. James Proimos's illustrations are 
            stylistically simple but wisely executed, full of sensitivity and power and poignancy, along with 
            occasional moments of whimsy (that cat!)."
